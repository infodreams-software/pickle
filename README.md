# pickle
A Flutter plugin to support BDD testing using Cucumber-like syntax and Gherkin-style feature files.

Pickle is a lightweight Flutter and Dart testing library designed to bring the simplicity and clarity of Cucumber-style testing to your projects.

With Pickle, you can write tests using .feature files that follow the familiar Gherkin syntax and define your step implementations directly in code. The goal is to fully embrace the Cucumber philosophy: readable tests, clean step definitions, and fast setup without unnecessary boilerplate or complex configuration.

Pickle is ideal for developers who want to:

Write expressive, behavior-driven tests for Flutter and Dart apps
Keep test logic separate from test descriptions
Avoid heavy frameworks and complicated setup procedures
Whether you're working on a small Dart package or a large Flutter app, Pickle aims to make BDD-style testing as seamless and intuitive as possible.
